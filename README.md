# MECA
This Repository contains the source code of the **Multipurpose Enhanced Cognitive Architecture (MECA)**.

MECA is a Java library to build cognitive architectures / artificial minds for robots and software agents. MECA provides a framework with different capabilities out of the box for artificial minds to be built upon.

MECA has been built on top of the [Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST)](https://github.com/CST-Group/cst). It is therefore important to know CST's concepts and how to implement cognitive architectures using CST in order to make a better use of MECA.

Note: This library is still under development, and some concepts or features might not be available yet. [Feedback/bug report](https://github.com/CST-Group/meca/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/CST-Group/meca/pulls) are most welcome!

## Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/CST-Group/meca/releases) and set it as a dependency in your project. (soon to be available in a repository such as MavenCentral).

## Changelog / Migrations

Follow the [release](https://github.com/CST-Group/meca/releases) page to better understand the breaking changes of new versions.

## Requirements

MECA requires at minimum Java 8.

## Example

To get started, you can take a look at our [hands on codelab](https://github.com/CST-Group/codelab-meca) which teaches you how to use MECA's version 0.0.1. (soon we will provide more examples in the library repository).

## Publications

Refer to  MECA's publications to better understand the concepts behind the implemented code structures:
